# NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT-ENERGY-GENERATED-PREDICTION

## Problem Statement:
              Predict the Electrical Energy generated by a Nuclear Power Plant.
### Some of the attributes of the dataset:

 1. Ambient Temperature

 2. Exhaust Vaccume

 3. Ambient Pressure

 4. Relative Humidity

 5. Electrical Energy Output

### Solution:
             As the dependent variable is of numeric value type, we can use Regression Algorithms 

Some of the availble classification algorithms are:

 1. Linear Regression

 2. Multiple Linear Regression
 
 3. Polynomial Regression

 4. Decision Tree Regressor
 
 5. Random Forest Regressor

 6. SVM Regressor

           In our Solution we are using Random Forest Regresser in order to get a accurate prediction.
